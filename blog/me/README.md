# #me

I'm a developer who mostly works with Go and JavaScript.

## This blog

This blog is written in [gitbook](https://gitbook.com) as a personal blog.

### TODO

- Comments using RocksDB

  RocksDB provides a simple in-process key-value storage with [concurrent inserts](http://smalldatum.blogspot.com/2016/02/concurrent-inserts-and-rocksdb-memtable.html). I can write a thin layer to allow comments on the blog.
